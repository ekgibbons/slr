# slr
Python implementation of SLR RF design.  Much of this is based on the Pauly/LeRoux paper and the Pauly RF tools Matlab package.  
This package does require some external packages, particularly the latest version of boost (v1.63).  At the moment this is installed by source.  Information can be found [here](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html).
